    "In the world of computer graphics, triangles are a great way to create 3D models. Using sufficiently many triangles could yield any 3D shape that you would ever want (even if sufficiently many can mean \"infinitly many\" with curved surfaces, but if you use enough, know one will be able to tell the difference. It will look just like a curved surface, and that its just triangles can stay our little secret!)\n",
    "The easies way to define a triangle is by means of its corner positions. That is all info that we need right now!\n",

    "To simulate light, we need to be able to simulate light rays. Because this is a basic ray-tracer, we will do something that might seem a bit weird. instead of sending \"photons\" from our lamps and seeing how they fall onto the camera, as would happen in the real world, we will do the opposite. We start  from the camera's point of view and look at the scene.\n",
