    "# Intro to raytracing in python\n",
    "Welcome to this introduction to ray tracing using the worlds most beautiful programming language, Python.\n",
    "In this introduction, we will build a ray-tracer.\n",
    "This ray-tracer will mostly have basic features, but understanding them is essential for more advanced ray-tracing work.\n",
    "Although Python is awesome, it might not be the 'ideal' language for a ray tracer. Python is however very readable.\n",
    "So if you want to program your own ray-tracer, by all means, do it in C, C++ or a similarly performant language later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "I strongly encourage you to follow along with this tutorial and to build your own ray tracer, as it will help you understand all related concepts.\n",
    "All the code in this tutorial is runnable because this is a jupyter notebook.\n",
    "You can run the code as you go, or you can run all cells while you read.\n",
    "I also made a python file with the final code that you can use as a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you really can not wait to see what you will be able to create at the end of this tutorial,\n",
    "you can check out the MP4 that is in this folder.\n",

    "\n",
    "The two fundamental parts of a ray-tracer are rays and triangles.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of computer graphics, triangles are a great way to create 3D models.\n",
    "Using sufficiently many triangles you could make any 3D shape that you would ever want, even if \"sufficiently many\" can mean \"infinitely many\" with curved surfaces, but if you use enough, most will not be able to tell the difference.\n",
    "It will look like a curved surface. That it is just triangles will be our little secret!\n",
    "The easiest way to define a triangle is via its corner positions.\n",
    "We will also calculate the surface normal of the triangle.\n",
    "This is the vector that is perpendicular to the triangle.\n",
    "We calulate the normal by taking the cross product of the vector reprecenting two of the triangles edges.\n",
    "The cross product returns a vector that is perpendicular to both the edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "![sphere from triangles](https://i.stack.imgur.com/RhJgj.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "To simulate light, we will simulate light rays. Because this is a basic ray-tracer, we will do something that might seem a bit weird.\n",
    "instead of sending \"photons\" from our lamps and seeing how they fall onto the camera, as it happens in the real world, we will do the opposite.\n",
    "We start from the camera's point of view and look at the scene.\n",

    "- material properties for triangles\n",

    "\n",
    "### Material properties\n",
    "The material properties will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- diffuse reflectivity (Kd)\n",
    "- specular reflectivity (Ks)\n",
    "- shininess (Ns)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffuse reflectivity is the amount of light that falls on the object that will be bounced back from its surface into all directions.\n",
    "If you were to shine a laser pointer at an object with high diffuse reflectivity, you would see a bright spot on the surface of that object where the laser hits, no matter from which side you are looking.\n",
    "Diffuse reflections happen mostly on rough surfaces, for example with paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specular reflections are mirror-like reflections where the light that falls on the object gets reflected with the same angle from the object.\n",
    "I do not recommend that you try the experiment with the laser on a specular surface.\n",
    "If the surface is purely specular (not diffuse), you would not even see that there is a laser shining on the object, unless you move your head in just the \"right\" spot.\n",
    "When your eye is directly in the mirror direction of the incoming laser beam it is time to go to the eye doctor though, since you are directly looking into the laser beam.\n",
    "This happens with smooth surfaces, for example, a highly polished piece of metal\n",
    "\n",
    "The shininess property is a measure of how smooth the surface is.\n",
    "Most materials are not perfect mirrors.\n",
    "They might be shiny, but the specular reflection has a bit of spread.\n",
    "Higher shininess means that the surface is more mirror-like, and thus the spread of the specular reflection is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Light sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The material properties all mention \"incoming light\". \n",
    "The light has to come from a source.\n",
    "For this, we need a \"PointLight\" class.\n",
    "PointLights have only two properties,\n",
    "- how much light they emit (including the color)\n",
    "- the position of the light\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the light sources!\n",
    "We will also add a \"get_pos\" function to get the position of the light.\n",
    "This might seem like an un-pythonic thing to do, but it will be useful later on!"

    "Hard shadows are what you would get with an infinitely small point light.\n",
    "In the real world, light sources are not infinitely small.\n",
    "With bigger light sources, there is not only an area that is completely hidden from the light but also a penumbra.\n",
    "The penumbra is a transition area, where only part of the light is occluded. Both together form the shadow region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is easier, in this chapter we will implement hard-shadows.\n",
    "Every time, before we use the diffuse and specular functions, we need to find out if there is an unobstructed path between the object and the light source.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "Congratulations!\n",
    "You have now completed this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have covered a lot of ray tracing topics.\n",
    "We started with some simple triangles and ended with our own 3D animated movie.\n",
    "You now know some of the basic optimizations that can be done to improve the performance of ray tracing.\n",
    "This, however, is only the beginning.\n",
    "I would like to give a few ideas for things that you can research next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding more triangles really slows down the ray tracer that we just build.\n",
    "Our bounding box optimization can be improved to increase the performance on scenes with lots of triangles.\n",
    "To learn more about this, read about k-d trees.\n",
    "k-d trees use a tree-like structure of bounding boxes.\n",
    "When testing if a ray hits something, you first test if the outermost bounding box is hit, just like with our ray tracer.\n",
    "If that is the case you look at the smaller bounding boxes inside of the outer bounding box.\n",
    "This continues until you reach the lowest level of bounding boxes.\n",
    "Then you need to check for a hit with all triangles in that bounding box.\n",
    "This can be done quickly, because there likely aren't many triangles in the lowest level bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenes can also be made more realistic looking by using Monte-Carlo methods, such as is called path tracing.\n",
    "Here you simulate how light bounces from one object onto another even if the objects are not mirror-like at all. Yes, this happens, because otherwise the light from an object would never reach your eye .\n",
    "This is done by simulating rays in random directions on every bounce to sample the incoming light from other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I would like to recommend looking into volumetric path tracing.\n",
    "Here you don't only consider objects like triangles, but also volumes.\n",
    "Volumes can be made from semi-transparent materials like smoke.\n",
    "This can give a very cool and photorealistic look to your renders!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have been coding along, make sure to send me some of your renders.\n",
    "I would love to see them!\n",
    "n.j.m.jadoenathmisier@student.tudelft.nl\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I will leave you with an image that I made.\n",
    "For the ray-tracer that I used to render this image, I have implemented k-d trees and (volumetric) path tracing.\n",
    "\n",
