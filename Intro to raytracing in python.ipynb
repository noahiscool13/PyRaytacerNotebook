    "It will look just like a curved surface, and that its just triangles can stay our little secret!)\n",
    "The easies way to define a triangle is by means of its corner positions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Material properties\n",
    "The material properties will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "- diffuse reflectivity (Kd)\n",
    "- specular reflectivity (Ks)\n",
    "- shininess (Ns)\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffuse reflectivity is the amount of light that falls on the object that will be bounced back from its surface into all directions.\n",
    "If you where to shine a laser pointer at a object with high diffuse reflectivity, you would see a bright spot on the surface of that object on the spot where the laser hits, no matter from which side you are looking.\n",
    "Diffuse reflections happen mostly on rough surfaces, for example with paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specular reflections are mirror like reflections where the light that falls on the object gets reflected with the same angle from the object.\n",
    "I do not recommend that you try the experiment with the laser on a specular surface.\n",
    "If the surface is purely specular (not diffuse), you wouldn't even see that there is a laser shining on the object, unless you move your head in just the \"right\" spot.\n",
    "When your eye is directly in the mirror direction of the incoming laser beam it's time to go to the eye-doctor, since it will look like you are directly looking into the laser beam.\n",
    "This happens with smooth surfaces, for example a highly polished peace of metal\n",
    "\n",
    "The shininess property is a measure of how smooth the surface is.\n",
    "Most materials are not perfect mirrors.\n",
    "They might be shiny, but the specular reflection has a bit of spread.\n",
    "Higher shininess means that the surface is more mirror like, and thus the spread of the specular reflection is lower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Light sources\n",
    "\n",
    "The material properties all mention \"incoming light\". \n",
    "The light has to come from a source.\n",
    "For this we need a \"PointLight\" class.\n",
    "PointLights have only two properties,\n",
